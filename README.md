## Background

As a hobby I produce music. Early in my coding journey while I was self-studying, I realized I wanted an elegant solution for providing a direct link to my music project on the Spotify streaming platform. I didn't want to sign up for yet another service (which I wouldn't have control over), I wanted something I could customize to my liking, and I needed a project would be simple enough to tackle at my coding level. This allowed me to stretch my HTML, SCSS, and JavaScript skills.

## How I Use This

While I still use this webpage on my socials for users to be directed to my Spotify profile, it's main use was directing traffic from Instagram Story Ads (via Facebook Ad Manager) while capturing page events to increase ad targeting via the Meta Pixel. Learning(ish) how to use Facebook Ad Manager was another hurtle, but I mostly got there.

The flow went like this:

1. Instagram Story Ad (using a video with audio I created), linking to...
2. My custom smart link page, linking to...
3. My Spotify artist's profile page, then...
4. Hopefully the user clicks "follow" and listens to some music!

## End Result

At the time of use (c. 2020-2022), with the power of social ads linking to my smart link page, I was able to increase my Spotify follower count from less than 200 to over 4k. Pretty cool!
